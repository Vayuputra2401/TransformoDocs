# Transformo Docs: Empowering Machine-Readable Document Management System

Transformo Docs is a powerful solution designed to convert non-machine-readable documents like PDFs, Word files, and Excel sheets into machine-readable formats. The app provides advanced text analysis, document analytics, and a unique chat feature that allows users to interact with uploaded documents.

## Features

- **Document Upload and Processing:** Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and XLSX files.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from uploaded documents and structures it for further analysis.
- **Text Analytics:** Analyzes document content to provide metrics like word count, sentence count, named entities, and keyword frequency.
- **Export Options:** Allows exporting structured data in JSON and XML formats.
- **Interactive Chat:** Chat with the uploaded document to ask questions and get answers in real-time.
- **Customizable:** The app leverages small, open-source language models like GPT-2 for text generation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Conda or pip for managing dependencies

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if you are using Conda:

```bash
conda create --name transformo-docs python=3.8
conda activate transformo-docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional Dependencies

- Install `spaCy` and the English language model:
  ```bash
  pip install spacy
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
  ```
- Install `PyPDF2` for PDF processing:
  ```bash
  pip install PyPDF2
  ```
- Install `python-docx` for DOCX file processing:
  ```bash
  pip install python-docx
  ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a Document:**
   - Choose a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLSX) using the upload button.

3. **View and Analyze the Document:**
   - The app processes the document and displays text analytics, including word count, sentence count, and common entities/keywords.

4. **Export Processed Data:**
   - Download the structured data in JSON or XML format.

5. **Chat with the Document:**
   - Ask questions about the document's content through the chat interface and receive answers generated by a small language model.

6. **Clear Chat History:**
   - Optionally clear the chat history to start a new conversation with the document.

## Customization

You can customize the language model used for text generation by modifying the following code in `app.py`:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a smaller LLM, like GPT-2 or GPT-J
@st.cache_resource
def load_llm_model():
    return pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")  # You can use a different model if needed
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit app script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Known Issues

- If `spaCy` or any other optional dependency is not installed, some features (like advanced text analysis) will be limited.
- For large documents, the processing time may be longer.
